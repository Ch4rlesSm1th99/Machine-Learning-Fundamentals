# CFAR-10-CNN-and-RNN-image-classifier
This was another piece of examined work. First was desgining a CNN to classify images for a sub data set of the CIFAR 100 dataset called CIFAR 10. The second task was to classify the images again but this time using the pretrained res net 18 and making some slight modifications such that the classifier suited our specific problem.
