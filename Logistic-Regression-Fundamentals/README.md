# Logistic-Regression-Fundamentals

This code demonstrates logistic regression on synthetic data. The main steps include:
1. Generating random data points for two classes.
2. Visualizing the generated data points.
3. Implementing logistic regression:
    a. Forward propagation to compute predicted probabilities.
    b. Computation of loss using the log loss function.
    c. Backward propagation to compute gradients.
    d. Weight update using gradient descent.
4. Visualizing the decision boundary at various iterations.
5. Plotting the loss curve across iterations.
6. Comparing original labels with the predicted labels.

The visualization assists in understanding how the decision boundary changes as the algorithm learns from the data.
