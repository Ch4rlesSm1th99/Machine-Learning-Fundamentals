# Logistic-Regression-Non-Linear-Boundaries
This script performs binary classification on synthetic data using logistic regression. It first generates 2D points, classifying them into two groups based on their radial distance from the origin. These points are visualized in a scatter plot, differentiated by class. The script constructs a logistic regression model, extending the data's feature space with polynomials to capture complex boundaries. The model is trained via gradient descent, minimizing cross-entropy loss, with the training's efficacy demonstrated through a plot of loss over iterations. Post-training, the model's predictions are visualized on the data points. Additionally, the script applies scikit-learn's logistic regression in a pipeline with polynomial feature expansion, training it on the same data, and visualizing the predictions for comparison. Essentially, the script is a demonstration of building, training, and visualizing a binary classification model, alongside a comparison with scikit-learn's implementation.
